TODO:
1) learn md
2) Create a audio analysis window using matplotlib
> - **Needed Features**:
>> * labeled os subbands plotted as a function of time and magnitude (dB)
>> * Marked onsets with a line
>> * transformation curves of each subband as os peak filtering is performed on it
> - **Future Features**:
>> * labeled audio waveform
>> * transformation curve of audio waveform to each subband as os filtering is preformed on it
>> * scalable y axis for scale differences between raw audio and os
